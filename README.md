 ### Colour Scheme

 The colour scheme used was defined on COLORAMA python module

* __#FF80FF__ LIGHT MAGENTA was used to print a Tic Tac Toe logo, Welcome message and a Goodbye message
* __#FFFF00__ YELLOW was used to print instrucions and in a message about game ending in a tie as a neutral colour in the game
* __#00FF00__ GREEN was used to frame the instructions, light green version was used to print messages to the user like -
  place the letter and You have won. The resaon I have used the light green version is through testing I have found the contrast much more user friendly in pronted text
* __#FF0000__  RED colour I have used for printing out the computers moves, message that computer won the game and as warnings   about wrong input by the user
* __#FFFFFF__ WHITE is a default colour in the application and the game board is left as white  when it first prints in the game
